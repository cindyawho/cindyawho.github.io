    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    <h2><a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-working-with-text">Working with Text</a></h2>
    <p>In this lesson, we learned about creating text through HTML. Heading, paragraph, strong, emphasis and comment elements were all explained and shown in examples.</p>
    <p>Ensuring proper <strong>notation</strong> and <strong>indentation</strong> is very important. Moreover, strong and emphasis elements are used to indicate important text in the paragraph which is especially important for screen readers.</p>
    <p>This section was created for The Odin Project's <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-working-with-text">"Working with Text"</a> assignment #3.</p>
