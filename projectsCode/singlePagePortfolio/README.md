# Follow-Along-Coder-Coder-Single-Page-Developer-Portfolio
 
Hi! 
I followed along Coder Coder's video playlist at https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUWqFDiirlsuVOx2WWruGfw5nnuaWHNvI
I found it super helpful hearing the thinking process as they explained their problem-solving and looked through articles and specs to figure out the site. 
Since I did not have access to the original assets shown in the video, I decided to make it my own portfolio example! I learned how to create SVGs, convert from png to svg, and edit my own images to look nice on the website. 

Thank you Coder Coder!
