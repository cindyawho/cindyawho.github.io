    <h1>Give Fund Snapchat Feature</h1>
    <h3>2024 Snap Academies Foster Youth Team</h3>
    <p><em>** Note: Website under construction. Thank you for understanding. **</em></p>
    <p>Thank you so much for taking the time to look at this project that I created for Snap Academies 2024. It is the most involved project that I have been a part of and the product that I am proudest of.</p>
    <h3>So What Exactly is Give Fund?</h3>
    <p>Give Fund is a proposed Snapchat feature aimed at helping foster youth nonprofits raise funds for their impactful programs. Give Fund would let users donate in two ways: their own funds or Snap Give Coins. Users would earn 1 Give Coin for every sponsored video from nonprofits. Users can keep track of their Give Coins in their user profile or under a nonprofit's campaign progress bar. When a user donates to a nonprofit, their bitmoji gets added to the Bitmoji community to show their support.</p>
    <p>It was particularly special as I worked on a cross-functional team, implemented both front and back-end functionalities, and utilized React Native with related libraries all for the first time! I'd like to shout out Kyle Jussab, my engineering partner for having the stylistic vision and animations knowledge to really take our prototype to the next level.</p>
