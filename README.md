Hello!

Inspired by a Figma Design, I am coding this entire website from scratch! 
I have taken coding classes in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, C++, Python, and have really enjoyed coding!
This is the first website where I am not following along a video or doing it for an assignment. This is purely because I want to test my skills and practice my problem-solving. 

On here, I hope to:
- create a website that shows my skills
- create pages that include my resume, past teacher curriculums, coding projects, and piano videos
- learn more about Github and coding
- publish unique pages with my personal coding projects
- share it all with others!

Thank you for reading and hope you have a nice day! :D

-Cindy
